# Introduction

This package contains a poorly written, undocumented program that interacts with a fictitious cloud provider.

The file `src/cloud.ts` contains a mock implementation of the cloud provider SDK. You must use this file as-is without modifying it.

Your goal is to:

- Understand what the program does and how to run it.
- Fix the program bugs, if any.
- Refactor the code to be more maintainable. You're free to change the HTTP endpoints and introduce other libraries if you think it makes sense.

This task is open-ended and the end result doesn't need to be 100% perfect. Focus on what you think matters the most.

**Do not spend more than 3 hours on this task.**
